############### Our Blackjack House Rules #####################

## The deck is unlimited in size.
## There are no jokers.
## The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
## The the Ace can count as 11 or 1.
## Use the following list as the deck of cards:
## cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
## The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
## Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
## The computer is the dealer.

##################### Hints #####################

#Hint 1: Go to this website and try out the Blackjack game:
#   https://games.washingtonpost.com/games/blackjack/
#Then try out the completed Blackjack project here:
#   http://blackjack-final.appbrewery.repl.run

#Hint 2: Read this breakdown of program requirements:
#   http://listmoz.com/view/6h34DJpvJBFVRlZfJvxF
#Then try to create your own flowchart for the program.

#Hint 3: Download and read this flow chart I've created:
#   https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1rDkiHCrhaf9eX7u7yjM1qwSuyEk-rPnt

#Done: Hint 4: Create a deal_card() function that uses the List below to *return* a random card.
#11 is the Ace.

def deal_card():
  cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
  return random.choice(cards)
#Done: Hint 5: Deal the user and computer 2 cards each using deal_card() and append().


#Done: Hint 6: Create a function called calculate_score() that takes a List of cards as input
#and returns the score.
#Look up the sum() function to help you do this.

#Done: Hint 7: Inside calculate_score() check for a blackjack (a hand with only 2 cards: ace + 10) and return 0 instead of the actual score. 0 will represent a blackjack in our game.

#Done: Hint 8: Inside calculate_score() check for an 11 (ace). If the score is already over 21, remove the 11 and replace it with a 1. You might need to look up append() and remove().

#Hint 9: Call calculate_score(). If the computer or the user has a blackjack (0) or if the user's score is over 21, then the game ends.
def calculate_score(cards_list):
  sum_cards = sum(cards_list)
  if len(cards_list) == 2 and sum_cards == 21:
    #Black Jack !  21 score with two cards
    return 0

  if sum_cards > 21:
    for cnt in range(0, len(cards_list)):
      if cards_list[cnt] == 11:
        cards_list[cnt] = 1
        sum_cards = sum(cards_list)
  return sum_cards
  #Hint 10: If the game has not ended, ask the user if they want to draw another card. If yes, then use the deal_card() function to add another card to the user_cards List. If no, then the game has ended.

#Hint 11: The score will need to be rechecked with every new card drawn and the checks in Hint 9 need to be repeated until the game ends.


#Hint 13: Create a function called compare() and pass in the user_score and computer_score. If the computer and user both have the same score, then it's a draw. If the computer has a blackjack (0), then the user loses. If the user has a blackjack (0), then the user wins. If the user_score is over 21, then the user loses. If the computer_score is over 21, then the computer loses. If none of the above, then the player with the highest score wins.
def compare_score(user_score, computer_score):
  if user_score > 21:
    return "You went over. You lose ðŸ˜­"
  elif user_score == computer_score:
    return "Draw."
  elif user_score == 0:
    return "Black Jack ! You Win !! ðŸ˜Ž"
  elif computer_score > 21:
    return "Computer busted ! You Win !! ðŸ˜Ž"
  elif user_score > computer_score:
    return "You win !! ðŸ˜Ž"
  else:
    return "You loose !! ðŸ˜­"



#Hint 14: Ask the user if they want to restart the game. If they answer yes, clear the console and start a new game of blackjack and show the logo from art.py.

def play_game():
  user_cards = []
  computer_cards = []
  user_score = 0
  computer_score = 0
  is_game_over = False
  clear()
  print(logo)
  for _ in range(2):
    user_cards.append(deal_card())
    computer_cards.append(deal_card())

  while not is_game_over:
    user_score = calculate_score(user_cards)
    computer_score = calculate_score(computer_cards)
    print(f"User     has  cards: {user_cards}, score is {user_score}")
    print(f"Computer first card: {computer_cards[0]}")
    if user_score == 0 or computer_score == 0 or user_score > 21:
      is_game_over = True
    else:
      user_should_deal = input("Deal another card for You ('y' or 'n')? ")
      if user_should_deal == "y":
         user_cards.append(deal_card())
         user_score = calculate_score(user_cards)
      else:
        is_game_over = True

#Hint 12: Once the user is done, it's time to let the computer play. The computer should keep drawing cards as long as it has a score less than 17.

  while computer_score != 0 and computer_score < 17:
    computer_cards.append(deal_card())
    computer_score = calculate_score(computer_cards)

  print(f"   Your final hand: {user_cards}, final score: {user_score}")
  print(f"   Computer's final hand: {computer_cards}, final score: {computer_score}")
  print(compare_score(user_score, computer_score))

#Main loop
while input("Do you want to play a game of Blackjack? Type 'y' or 'n': ") == "y":
  clear()
